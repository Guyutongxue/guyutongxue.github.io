# Fragments of *The Phantom of the Opera*
## Scene I

**RAOUL**  
Christine Daae, where is your scarf?  
**CHRISTINE**  
Monsieur?  
**RAOUL**  
You can't have lost it. After all the trouble I took.   
I was just fourteen and soaked to the skin...  
**CHRISTINE**  
Because you had run into the sea to fetch my scarf.   
Oh, Raoul. So it is you!  
**RAOUL**  
Christine.  
**RAOUL**  
"Little Lotte let her mind wander..."  
**CHRISTINE**  
You remember that, too...  
**RAOUL** (continuing)  
"...Little Lotte thought: Am I fonder  
of dolls..."  
**BOTH** (**CHRISTINE** joining in)  
"...or of goblins,  
of shoes..."  
**CHRISTINE**  
"...or of riddles.  
of frocks..."  
**RAOUL**  
Those picnics in the attic...  
"...or of chocolates..."  
**CHRISTINE**  
Father playing the violin...  
**RAOUL**  
As we read to each other   
dark stories of the North...  
**CHRISTINE**  
"No what I love best, Lotte said,  
is when I'm asleep in my bed,  
and the Angel of Music sings songs in my  
head!"  
**BOTH**  
"...the Angel of Music sings song in my  
head!"  
**CHRISTINE**  
Father said, "When I'm in heaven, child, I will send the   
Angel of Music to you". Well, father is dead, Raoul, and   
I have been visited by the Angel of Music.  
**RAOUL**  
No doubt of it. And now we'll go to supper!  
**CHRISTINE**  
No, Raoul, the Angel of Music is very strict.  
**RAOUL**  
I shan't keep you up late!  
**CHRISTINE**  
No, Raoul...  
**RAOUL**  
You must change. I must get my hat. Two minutes Little   
Lotte.  
**CHRISTINE**  
Raoul!  
Things have changed, Raoul.  
**PHANTOM'S VOICE**  
Insolent boy!  
This slave  
of fashion  
basking in your  
glory!  
Ignorant fool!  
This brave  
young suitor,  
sharing in my  
triumph!  
**CHRISTINE**  
Angel! I hear you!  
Speak-  
I listen...  
stay by my side,  
guide me!  
Angel, my soul was weak -  
forgive me...  
enter at last,   
Master!  
**PHANTOM'S VOICE**  
Flattering child,  
you shall know me,  
see why in shadow  
I hide!  
Look at your face  
in the mirror-  
I am there  
inside!  
**CHRISTINE**  
Angel of Music!  
Guide and guardian!  
Grant to me your  
glory!  
Angel of Music!  
Hide no longer!  
Come to me, strange  
angel...  
**PHANTOM'S VOICE**  
I am your Angel...  
Come to me: Angel of Music ...  
**RAOUL**  
Whose is that voice...?  
Who is that in there...?  
**PHANTOM**  
I am your Angel of Music...  
Come to me: Angel of Music...  
**RAOUL**  
Christine! Angel!

## Scene II

**CHRISTINE**  
Who was that shape  
in the shadows?  
Whose is the face  
in the mask?  
**PHANTOM**  
Damn you!  
You little prying  
Pandora!  
You little demon -  
is this what you wanted to see?  
Curse you!  
You little lying  
Delilah!  
You little viper!  
now you cannot ever be free!  
Damn you...  
Curse you...
